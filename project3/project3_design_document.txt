      PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
      =====================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

    struct hash pages
    : Used for supplemental page table entry.
      It is used as hash entry in the struct hash "pages"
      which is defined as a member of struct thread.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.

    It just linearly scan the bitmap which has enough pages for allocating.


>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

    In case that using both user and kernel virtual addresses,
    it might be hard to manage accessed and dirty bits.
    Therefore, we decided to only use user virtual addresses
    when accessing user data to avoid the issue.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

    If the situation occurs, one process which has higher process id
    can be allocated first.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

    Hash table can search entries fast and use memory in a
    effecient way of using chaining method.

           PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
           =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

    Nothing added for the paging between the disk and physical memory.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

    A page which has 0 accessed bit is evicted first.
    When all evict bits are 1, the first frame will be evicted.


>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?

    Our implementation makes the page table entry of Q invalid
    and frees the pool allocated previously.


>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

    First, check if the address is valid or not.
    When it is lower than esp, it is invalid.
    Then, in case of valid address, we check stack growth condition
    If the address is over the growth limit (PGSIZE), stack growth fails.
    Otherwise, extend stack by one page.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)

    First, Resoucres should be used by single process at one time.
    While one process is using the resource, other processes should wait for it.
    For this, we can use many synchronization methods, such as semaphore.
    Also kernel should not preempt a process using some resources.
    Lastly, there should be no circular wait.

>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How do you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?

    We can use a lock for preventing Q from accessing the page.
    But, actually, we cannot stop the threshold situation
    where process P and Q evict the same frame.
 

>> B7: Suppose a page fault in process P causes a page to be read from
>> the file system or swap.  How do you ensure that a second process Q
>> cannot interfere by e.g. attempting to evict the frame while it is
>> still being read in?

    This situation can be prevented from the lock synchronization method.
    It ensures that only single process can access a resource at a time.


>> B8: Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur
>> during system calls.  Do you use page faults to bring in pages (as
>> in user programs), or do you have a mechanism for "locking" frames
>> into physical memory, or do you use some other design?  How do you
>> gracefully handle attempted accesses to invalid virtual addresses?

    We trigger a page fault for the paged-out pages during system calls routine.
    To prevent invalid accesses, each process is designed to have valid range of memory address.
    For example, each process has base address and size of code and data segment.
    Also, it checks validity of fault address using the esp which is one of members of struct thread.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: A single lock for the whole VM system would make
>> synchronization easy, but limit parallelism.  On the other hand,
>> using many locks complicates synchronization and raises the
>> possibility for deadlock but allows for high parallelism.  Explain
>> where your design falls along this continuum and why you chose to
>> design it this way.

    We choose the former because it is very challanging to debug deadlock situation.
    Although there are some performance loss, we judged that it is better
    to avoid deadlock.

       MEMORY MAPPED FILES
       ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

    Those are defined in struct thread in threads/thread.h
    uint32_t *esp : Indicates stack pointer of each process.
    uint32_t *code_segment_base : Indicates the base address of code segment which is 0x8048000
    uint32_t code_segment_size : Indicates the size of code segment
    uint32_t *data_segment_base : Indicates the base address of (initialized) data segment 
    uint32_t data_segment_size : Indicates the size of data segment
    uint32_t *mapping[10] : mapping information of memory mapped file for each proess

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

    Identically, it occurs a page fault which is not mapped file.
    Page fault caused by 'load' function inserts pages,
    triggers the page fault and finds at the hash table.
    But memory mapped file case does not insert pages into the hash table.


>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

    The base addresses and sizes of each segment stored in struct thread
    are used for detecting the overlapping case. Therefore, the overlapping
    case can be detected by using these information.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of

>> the two situations.

    It shares semantics which use the page_fault function.
    A case of data demand-paged from executables inserts hash page
    into the hash table in the load_segment function.
    Except for the fact they share similar control flow and
    equally trigger page fault for faulting address of page.

         SURVEY QUESTIONS
